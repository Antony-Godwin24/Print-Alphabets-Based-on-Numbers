# Print-Alphabets-Based-on-Numbers
This Java program reads an input string containing letters followed by numbers and prints the letters multiple times based on the number. It extracts alphabetic characters, retrieves the following digits, and prints the letters accordingly. If the input is invalid (e.g., starts with a number), it displays an error message.
